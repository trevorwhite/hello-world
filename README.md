# hello-world

We are actually going to remove "first repository" so that I can see the difference here.


Trevor is practicing how to do all this crazy programming stuff and simply understanding the pathing is the first step.
We look forward to learning more all the time right!!

Just going to make some changes to this file to see what happens

x = 25
print ('my name is twhite')

print (x)

I should be changing the helloworld document so these changes should be showing up
